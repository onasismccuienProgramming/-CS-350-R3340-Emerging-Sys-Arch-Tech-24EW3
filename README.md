#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Module three focused on peripherals, and how peripherals were utlized in connecting to external sensors and actuators.
This project explained how states operated.  For example, the state of an led in the on or off mode.  Depending on the state, determines whether or not 
if the led would be lit up, or off.  The intruduction of the state machine diagram offered a step by step explanation as the what the project was actually set up to do.
Once I get a better understanding of the state machine diagrams, things started to become a little bit more lucid.


#What did you do particularly well?

What I think that I did somewhat decently, was the journal assignments.  I could explain to you what action
that I was wanting to take, but I struggled with relaying that message in code form.



#Where could you improve?

My improvment was needed tin the coding.  I will just have to do my do diligence going forward, and write more c code.  


#What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I will definitely be adding the CCS3220 board.  Even though I can still improve my skill regarding its use,
I now have a better understanding as far as connecting the board to the computer, and having them communicate
with one another.



#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

As I stated above.  Having the ability to connected a aurdrino type board to my computer and 
read and also modify and create code, and the ability to trouble shoot or test this code.


#How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I just did the best that I could.  I sought examples on the internet.  I sought examples from zybooks.  I asked my
fellow classmates for help as well.
